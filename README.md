# CA274-Programming-for-Data-Analysis

### A repository containing some assignments done as part of the assessment for my CA274- Programming for Data Analysis module.

### To briefly sum up the assignments, we used a set of digits and looked at classifying the digits first with the closest digits in the set of digits and then in the second assignement we generated our own digits and checked how well they matched digits from the original set. Below the assignment specs and final PDF's can be seen.

### Assignement 1: [Spec](Assignment-1/Assignment-1.pdf) | [Final PDF](Assignment-1/CA274-Assignment-1-Adam-Tegart.pdf)

### Assignement 2: [Spec](Assignment-2/Assignment-2.pdf) | [Final PDF](Assignment-2/CA274-Assignment-2-Adam-Tegart.pdf)
